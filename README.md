## TL;DR

This package is meant mostly for myself, anything should be pastable from `src` .

```sh
pnpm i pastable
```

With 1 main & 3 specific entrypoints:

-   `"pastable"`: re-exports everything from utils/react/typings
-   `"pastable/utils"`
-   `"pastable/react"`
-   `"pastable/typings"`

```ts
import { useSelection } from "pastable";

//  or

import { useSelection } from "pastable/react";
```

## ‚ö° Motivations

In every project I've been a part of, I've always ended up copy/pasting some part of a previous project that I had made generic, and moving from one project to another I just kept pasting it over and over.

So here we are, I made yet another multi-purpose-utils package !

## üé® Code style

It aims to be as generic as possible so that either the source can litteraly be pasted if you just need a couple of functions or you can install any specific package at some point.

100% written in Typescript, near 100% code coverage as a constant goal.

Feel free to contribute if you think there is space for one of your previous projects gems.
