# pastable

_A collection of pastable code gathered from past projects._

## Motivations

In every project I've been a part of, I've always ended up copy/pasting some part of a previous project that I had made generic, and moving from one project to another I just kept pasting it over and over.

So here we are, I made yet another multi-purpose-utils package !

## Code style

It aims to be as generic as possible so that either the source can litteraly be pasted if you just need a couple of functions or you can install any specific package at some point.

100% written in Typescript, near 100% code coverage as a constant goal.

Feel free to contribute if you think there is space for one of your previous projects gems.

## Built with

The repo is a Yarn 2 monorepo for now, that might change since it doesn't support ESM, idk yet.

Packages are built with https://github.com/developit/microbundle & tested with https://github.com/lukeed/uvu, special thanks to their authors for those priceless gems !
